  - CC-(4): Add a indexDB system
    - update all the calls
    - test to see how easy it is to switch from different DB's, it should be easy
    - test the limits for how much data we can store on indexDB

  - CC-(?): We need this to be live
  - CC-(?): Implement proper Server vs Client rendering
  - CC-(?): We need a database
  - CC-(?): We need some instructions

IDEAS:
  - id love to have it so this app is as cheap to run as possible
    - the plan: have two options, 1 is to host your own data using indexDB but you can only use the service from one device, and 2 is to host your own data on google sheets if you have an account or want to make one
