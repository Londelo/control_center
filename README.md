TODO:

  - CC-(6): Create a just for today to do list
  
  - CC-(?): Create Google Sign in and Excel DB, and a way to switch from Excel DB to IndexDB
  - CC-(?): We need this to be live
  - CC-(?): Implement proper Server vs Client rendering
  - CC-(?): We need some instructions

IDEAS:
  - id love to have it so this app is as cheap to run as possible
    - the plan: have two options, 1 is to host your own data using indexDB but you can only use the service from one device, and 2 is to host your own data on google sheets if you have an account or want to make one
