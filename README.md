TODO:
  - CC-(4): Add a indexDB system
    - done centralize/optimize css
    - done make new indexDB file
    - done create export btn
    - done update all the calls to support indexDB
    - done set up db and logic for standards list, seperated from the power lists
    - done clean up css
    - done test to see how easy it is to switch from different DB's, it should be easy
    - done remove HandleKeyDown
    - done test the limits for how much data we can store on indexDB

  - CC-(?): Create a just for today to do list
  - CC-(?): Create Google Sign in and Excel DB, and a way to switch from Excel DB to IndexDB
  - CC-(?): We need this to be live
  - CC-(?): Implement proper Server vs Client rendering
  - CC-(?): We need a database
  - CC-(?): We need some instructions
  - CC-(?): Separate the concerns of powerlist and standard in app. e.g. userPowerListService

IDEAS:
  - id love to have it so this app is as cheap to run as possible
    - the plan: have two options, 1 is to host your own data using indexDB but you can only use the service from one device, and 2 is to host your own data on google sheets if you have an account or want to make one
